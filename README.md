EDA on MTA Translate Date
The objective of this project was exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the publicly available MTA 
dataset. I aim to provide insight into the fictional entity (RSTABUS), a fictional bus company 
covering several regions in the USA. Interested in transporting passengers from several specific hubs 
to destination stations throughout the day, wants to cover more high demand areas and there are no 
buses available for customers to connect them to the destination station, they need to know the bus 
stops(locations) with the mentioned specifications, worked with MTA dataset, Using EDA to provide 
the required results. Finally, a model with the required specifications was built after several EDA 
operations.
